        descrip3="It is a logo with lines of the same thickness that will serve to be used as a watermark and can be seen at a greater distance as it can be on top of buildings on posters.
        The typography also follows these rules. While the tagline is a thinner and dry stick typography, its use will be more reduced, that is to say, it will be used when the reading distance is not illegible or necessary."
