        overview=" A colaboration project with Binary Colossus. My contribution to The Adverspot project consists of all the graphic support  for the app including videos and some videos of the customers of the application, it is an application for tourism purposes and where the user has little time so it has to be very intuitive as it is only used in the journey of a cab about 5 to 10 min on average, the design has to be direct and intuitive."

My goal was to facilitate navigation, in an intuitive way, the process should be as simple as possible, with a clear iconography and respecting the video area, which is the most important part and should always be visible. It also has several languages, among the sections you can choose are: Monuments, leisure places, museums, leisure activities in the city and events. enter the internet with filters, activate the route and the voice translator.."
        descrip2="The application divides the view into 2 layouts. The left one contains the advertising and the right one the user interaction. Each section of services has a color in the icons and in the background to locate more quickly to the user in which section is located. It was essential to maintain the activation or cancellation of sound as it could be annoying for the user."
        descrip3="Two typefaces were used: Futura for the long text and Bold Sansation for titles, the radio contrast is correct on all screens. Each element breathes, using the space strategically to highlight what is of interest."

If there is no previous previously visited, these buttons will be disabled, and the back button to return to the main menu."
