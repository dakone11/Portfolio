"
        descrip3="Finally I introduced the logotype inside the logo so that the letter o is the protagonist since it separates trastero and  plus. The letter o stands out for being a different typography in which it has been redesigned to give sense to the brand and perseverance and I think that it stays easier in the subconscious."
