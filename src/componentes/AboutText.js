            </h2>

            finish I plan, design, build, test and replicate digital products. I
            have the ability to create different multimedia content to connect

              I consider myself a person with Creativity, empathy, organization,
              always open mind, and communicative. I always try to be emotional
              and create a good relationship between the design and the user . I
              complement more with UX UI for my design and illustration skills.

              </h2>
              I am completing my knowledge React and JS codes. I finish this
              year a Master for front end developer in ESAT Valencia.. Design
              and code! could not exist without the other. Having said that, I
              find joy in development by bringing design to life, which is why I
              would not classify myself as a "hardcore developer", but as one
              who can bring two philosophies and ways of thinking together.
              Being multidisciplinary is a big part of my ethics. Be it design,
              development, video or UX; I'm there!
